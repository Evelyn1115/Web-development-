    <p>
      I successfully hosted a speaking club with 100 participants. I reserached
      useful things for my participants to learn about. I made appealing ppt
      slides and a good sharing session for them. I added not only fun games but
      also breakout room sessions, so that my participants can practise their
      English while having fun and networking well.

      volunteers in our organization. I got a lot of good feedbacks from my
      peers and juniors. After that training, a lot of my peers told me that
      they felt their communication skills improved because of me.

      As an Executive Board member of Youth Know-versity, I participated in the
      fair named Youthnified. This fair was dedicated for youths to communicate
      and learn about volunteering. I participated in that event with my board

      my peer scholars from other nations. It was an invaluable experience for
